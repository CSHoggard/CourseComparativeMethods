# Lecture 4 - BayesTraits

Bayesian reconstruction of ancestral states using BayesTraits, Testing the correlated evolution of discrete traits, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses, MCMC chain convergence.

## BayesTraits Wrapper (BTW)

The BayesTraits Wrapper was originally written by Randi Griffin. However, I slightly modified the function to allow the function to run on multiple platforms and to use BayesTraits version 2.
