# Half-day workshop on Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS)

This folder contains material for a half-day workshop introducing Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS) and learn how to implement it in the R language. It contains a [pdf presentation](http://github.com/simjoly/CourseComparativeMethods/blob/master/WorkshopPGLS_halfday/PGLS_presentation.pdf), as well as a tutorial that is available either as a [web page](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?http://github.com/simjoly/CourseComparativeMethods/blob/master/WorkshopPGLS_halfday/StatsPhylo.html) (html document) or as a [pdf document](http://github.com/simjoly/CourseComparativeMethods/blob/master/WorkshopPGLS_halfday/StatsPhylo.pdf). The source code in R Markdown (.Rmd) is also available.
